<h2> Hi Everone</h2>

<p>Thanks for visiting my profile.</p>
<p>This is an area for me to explore some concepts from basic to as complex as I can manage.
I started programming as an engineer using Pascal then moved over to C/C++. I'm using this space to discover the rest of this 'stack' that everyone talks about and to develop some new skills as I go.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contribute to anything I have made public and do reach out to engage.</P>
