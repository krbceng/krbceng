### Hi Everone ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my profile. This is an area for me to explore some concepts from basic to as complex as I can manage.
I'm predominantly a C/C++ guy but I hope to develop some new skills as I go.

Please feel free to contribute to anything I have made public and do reach out to engage.
